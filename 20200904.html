MORE STATIC WEBSITE GENERATION
 
As far as I have been able to find out, it's not possible to use the sftp command without requiring 
at least a little bit of interaction. There's no scp-like syntax that allows me to identify the 
source (files/dirs), destination (dir), authentication, and execution all in a single line. So 
instead I'm relying on PySFTP to do the hard work.

I'm hard-coding the username and password for now (although not telling any of you - I hope you'll 
forgive me). I may come back to this script and make it more general purpose at some point but for 
now I need to just get this working by Sunday night.
Here are the files and required actions:
1. The complete HTML of a new blog post must be uploaded to mydomain.com/blog/YYYYmmdd_title.html
2. The current mydomain.com/blog.html must be updated to include the latest post
3. ...that mydomain.com/blog.html page does not exist yet! Let's get on that first:

Each page of my portfolio site has a wide left column for content and a narrower right column for 
links to my resume, my bio, my blog, and my online presence. The content side of the blog.html page 
will have rectangular blocks with the title of that post plus the first few lines/words/letters 
(depending on how large the viewport is) of the post itself.

<div class="column">
<!--START content
	^ this comment lets the Python script know where to insert content-->

<a href="blog/one.html">
	<div class="postcontainer">
		<h3>Blog title</h3>
		<p class="blog_preview">First paragraph of a new blog can go here - it only displays one 
		line up to the end of the postcontainer div.</p>
	</div>
</a>

<a href="blog/two.html">
	<div class="postcontainer">
		<h3>Blog title 2</h3>
		<p class="blog_preview">Again, this p will contain the first paragraph (minus header) of 
		the blog, but much less will be visible on a typical screen.</p>
	</div>
</a>

<!--END content
	same story as above - just a signal to the Python script that generates pages-->
</div>

<!--CSS specific to the blog.html page looks like this:-->
<style>
.column a {
	text-decoration: none;
}

h3 {
	margin: 18px 0 6px 0;
	color: white;
	font-family: monospace;
	font-size: 14pt;
	font-weight: bold;
}

.postcontainer {
	width: 94%;
	height: 100px;
	margin-bottom: 8%;
	padding: 0 6px;
	border: 3px solid #dda;
}

.blog_preview {
	font-size: 11pt;
	text-overflow: ellipsis;
	overflow: hidden;
	white-space: nowrap;
}
<!-- the overflow and white-space settings are required to make text-overflow work correctly-->
</style>
